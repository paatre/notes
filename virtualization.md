# Virtualization

Virtualization is an overall term for creating a virtual version of something. There's hardware virtualization with *virtual machines*, operating-system-level-virtualization also known as *containerization* and multiple other types of virtualizations as well. During this time, this note focuses only virtual machines and containers, and between these two, mostly containers.[^1]

## Containers

Containers offer a way to package an application and its dependencies in a single executable unit, an *image*, which can be then be run in isolation from the host system as a *container*. This allows an ease of deployment regardless of the environment.
