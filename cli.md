# Command-line interfaces

## Terminology

There are multiple terms when talking about command-line interfaces (CLIs) which are interconnected and people also use them interchangeably but the terms actually have a different meaning from each other. More or less.

The terms are:
- terminal
- console
- command-line interface
- shell

What do these terms then mean? Let's go through them next.

### Terminal

Terminal is an environment or a device which can enter data into, and transcribe data from a computer via text.[^1] The first digital and programmable computers were built in 1940s and 1950s. Those computers could perform operations from input data but that data came from punched tape.[^2] In the 1950s and 1960s the first keyboard-printer terminals, a.k.a hard-copy terminals, were invented which printed the text data to a paper which started to replace punched tapes. During same time and later in the 1970s, video display units (VDU) were starting to be developed as well. The data moving between the computer and the terminal was shown in a display.[^1] Nowadays, we don't have physical terminals anymore but instead, we use terminal emulators. These are software applications that replicate the functionality of traditional hardware terminals within a graphical user interface (GUI). These emulators allow users to interact with their operating systems or software applications through text commands, much like the original hardware terminals.

### Console

Console usually refers to the device part of a terminal. Consoles and terminals can be used pretty interchangeably but one can be used over the other regarding the context.[^3]

### Command-line interface

The interface where you can interact with a computer by providing text line-by-line, usully in a terminal environment.[^4]

### Shell

Shell is a program, usually in a command-line interface, that acts as the middle-man between the operating system (kernel) and the user providing commands. The shell takes the provided commands, acts upon them via the kernel's API and returns the output to the user. This is also called REPL, read-eval-print loop.[^5]
